# COMP425-HW2
## Overview
This project encompasses the implementation of advanced computer vision techniques as part of Homework 2 for the COMP 425/COMP6341 Computer Vision, Winter 2024 session. The assignment is divided into two main parts: implementing the Hough transform to identify lanes in an image, and employing RANSAC for homography estimation to create a simple augmented reality application.

## Key Components
- Hough Transform: Utilizing the Hough transform for lane detection within a specified region of interest (ROI) in an image.
- RANSAC and Homography: Implementing RANSAC for robust homography estimation and applying this homography for an augmented reality task that overlays an image onto another within the correct perspective.

## Running the code
Navigate to the corresponding directory within the project folder in your terminal and execute the specific Python script for each part of the assignment.
- For the Hough Transform part:
  - Navigate to ./hough/
  - Run python hough.py
- For the RANSAC and Homography part:
  - Navigate to ./homography/
  - Run python run.py

Each script will generate visualization figures as required in the assignment instructions. These figures should be included in your report.
